# Educloud examples
This repository contains examples on how you can work and communicate with [IST EduCloud](https://educloud.ist.com). Each example keep their own documentation in their own readme files.

## Postman Collection
We have created a [postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection that you can download and use in postman to test out the APIs. Note that this requires that you have a key to our environment.
